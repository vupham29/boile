# ExpressJS Boilerplate Project

A boilerplate to build and bundle Javascript, PugJS code in server side.

I have created this for all the next projects I will build soon.

## About boilerplate

With expressjs-boilerplate, we can: (but in progress)

- [ ] Work with webpack to bundle and minimize code
- [x] Work well with PugJS
- [x] Installed necessary packages to build a nodeJS server.

## Deployment

Run `./public` in live server

```shell
npm run dev
```

Build files from `./src` and `./public` to `./dist` for production

```shell
npm run build:prod
```
